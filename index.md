Where am I ? 
	
> I live in Lausanne, Switzerland.

What for ? 

> I'm working as a trainee in Statistics at **`Nestlé`** (Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences). This internship is part of my master studies in applied mathematics at the EPFL.

Until ? 
	
> I'm going to leave Switzerland for **`Stanford University`** in San Francisco (USA) next September 2014. I'm going to be over there as a Visiting Student Researcher to do my master's thesis. My studies are going to be over and I am going to be a **`Master of Science MSc in Applied Mathematics`**.	
	
What can I do ? 

> I have been hardly (!) trained to apply statistical methods on various data. In other words: apply magic powder to your data and try to have meaningful answers about questions you did not have previously. This also means that I can do R, build packages, provide reports, etc.

Something else ?	

> Yeah ! I have been working as a software developer for many years. I used to build code in .NET with SQL databases. I have been in touch with internet languages. [ADD STUFF]
	
What else do I like ? 

> I love doing sports, squash mostly. In general I rarely say no to any sports.  I also like flying through the air (well... with my paraglider). Finally I enjoy visiting different countries, cultures, foods, etc.

Do you want more info ?

> You can have a look at my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/duvaneljulien) profile or consult my [CV](http://www.google.ch/).

Or maybe contact me ?
